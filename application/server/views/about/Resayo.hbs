    <p>I am an undergraduate senior at SFSU majoring in Computer Science and <br>
       minoring in Computer Engineering. I hope that after graduating I can <br>
       use from what I've learned and join the video game industry or become <br>
       a software engineer for a tech company. In my spare time I like to read, <br>
       play video games, write short stories/comic books ideas.
